# Overview 

## What is Training Bot? ðŸ¤–
Training Bot is a learning application that lets a team leader create a series of trainings and deliver them at a scheduled time via text or email to assigned learners. The user will be able to add members and assign them to a scheduled set of trainings with a start date. Each training will have a title, text body, and link. They should be small snippets that fit well in a text message sized post.

## Mission Statement ðŸ“œ
Training Bot empowers team leaders with tools to assist with their teamâ€™s continual learning.
